## Existing Observability Infrastructure

### Current Implementation
- **Structured Logging**: `/app/helpers/observability.ts` provides logging utilities
- **Performance Tracking**: `trackPerformance()` function for timing operations
- **Sentry Integration**: `/app/helpers/sentry.server.ts` for error tracking
- **Pino HTTP**: Express middleware for request logging

### Already Instrumented
- **Subscription Service**: Fully instrumented with logging and performance tracking
- **Error Handling**: Sentry integration for exception tracking
- **Basic Request Logging**: HTTP request/response logging via pino

## Recommended Observability Priorities

### High Priority (Core Business Logic)
1. **Message Processing Pipeline** - Activity tracking throughput and reliability
2. **Discord Bot Health** - Connection stability and event processing
3. **User Authentication Flow** - OAuth success rates and session management
4. **Command Execution** - Usage patterns and error rates

### Medium Priority (Feature Usage)
1. **Analytics Dashboard** - Query performance and user engagement
2. **Moderation System** - Effectiveness and accuracy metrics
3. **Guild Management** - Configuration and onboarding success
4. **Payment Processing** - Transaction success and conversion rates

### Low Priority (Operational)
1. **Database Performance** - Query optimization and connection health
2. **API Response Times** - General web interface performance
3. **Export Features** - CSV generation and download patterns

## Integration Approach

Each major feature area can be enhanced with:
- **Structured logging** using the existing `log()` function
- **Performance tracking** using the existing `trackPerformance()` wrapper
- **Custom metrics** for business-specific KPIs
- **Error tracking** via Sentry integration
- **Health checks** for system components

The application already has a solid foundation with the observability helpers and Sentry integration, making it straightforward to add comprehensive monitoring to each feature area.
