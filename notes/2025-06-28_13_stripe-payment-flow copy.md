# Stripe Payment Flow Implementation - 2025-06-28

## âœ… What We Built

### **Payment Flow Routes**
1. **`/upgrade`** - Upgrade page with Free vs Pro comparison
2. **`/payment/success`** - Payment confirmation and subscription activation  
3. **`/payment/cancel`** - Payment cancellation handling

### **Integration Points**
- **Upgrade Flow**: `/upgrade` â†’ `/redirects/stripe` (your existing route) â†’ Stripe â†’ success/cancel
- **Subscription Integration**: Auto-updates subscription tier upon payment success
- **Onboard Integration**: Added upgrade prompt to onboard page for free users
