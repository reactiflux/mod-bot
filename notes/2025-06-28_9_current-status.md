# Current Status - 2025-06-28

## âœ… Completed: Subscription Infrastructure
- Database table (`guild_subscriptions`) with Stripe integration fields
- Service layer (`SubscriptionService`) for tier management  
- Smart tier resolution with fallbacks
- Type-safe integration ready for Stripe webhooks
- Comprehensive productization analysis and roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ Where We Left Off
We successfully built the foundation for feature flags and monetization. The infrastructure is committed and ready.

## ðŸš€ Next Priorities
Based on our builder-focused plan:

1. **Web Onboarding Flow** - Replace manual `/setup` with Discord OAuth
2. **Dashboard Feature Gating** - Use subscription tiers to gate premium features
3. **Implement Actual Premium Features** - Add features worth paying for

## ðŸ’¡ Immediate Opportunities
- The dashboard already has CSV export functionality that could be gated
- Analytics features could be enhanced and made premium
- Multi-server support could be a paid tier benefit

## ðŸ”— Integration Points Ready
- SubscriptionService.hasFeature() ready for feature checks
- Guild initialization hooks ready for free tier setup
- Database schema ready for Stripe webhook processing

Ready to implement premium feature gating or onboarding improvements!
