# Updated Priorities - Multi-tenancy Already Done! - 2025-06-28

## âœ… Multi-tenancy Architecture - ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
Confirmed: Database schema already supports multiple guilds via guild_id isolation

## Revised Technical Priorities

### 1. **Web Onboarding Flow (Priority 1)**
**Current**: Manual `/setup` command requiring Discord knowledge
**Needed**: Guided OAuth flow for server owners
- Discord OAuth for server installation
- Automated bot invitation with permissions
- Web-based configuration replacing `/setup`
- Auto-detect server structure

### 2. **Dashboard Polish & Access (Priority 2)** 
**Current**: Auth exists but limited dashboard features
**Needed**: Full analytics interface (your main differentiator)
- Expose comprehensive analytics dashboard
- Real-time activity monitoring interface
- User management and moderation controls
- Export functionality for server owners

### 3. **Feature Gating Infrastructure (Priority 3)**
**Current**: No usage restrictions
**Needed**: Foundation for any future business model
- Message tracking limits
- Analytics export restrictions  
- Premium feature flags
- Usage monitoring

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Onboarding flow** - Biggest friction removal
2. **Dashboard exposure** - Your competitive advantage
3. **Basic gating** - Future-proofing

This significantly accelerates the timeline since the hardest architecture piece is done!
