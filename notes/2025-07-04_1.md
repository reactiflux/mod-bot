# Observability Integration Plan - July 4, 2025

## Project Overview
Systematic integration of observability practices across all major features of the Discord bot application, following the established pattern from the subscription service.

## Current State
- ‚úÖ Observability helpers in `app/helpers/observability.ts`
- ‚úÖ Business analytics in `app/helpers/metrics.ts` (Amplitude)
- ‚úÖ Subscription service fully instrumented as reference
- ‚úÖ Basic logging in gateway, routes, and some models
- ‚úÖ Sentry integration for error tracking

## Three-Layer Architecture
1. **Operational Observability** - System health, performance, debugging
2. **Business Analytics** - User behavior, product insights via Amplitude
3. **Infrastructure Monitoring** - Error tracking, stability via Sentry

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Business Logic (High Priority)
- Discord Bot Gateway & Event Handling
- Message Activity Tracking System  
- Discord Commands System

### Phase 2: User Experience (Medium Priority)
- User Management & Authentication
- Analytics & Dashboard
- Guild/Server Management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Lower Priority)
- Moderation & Automoderation
- Database Operations

## Key Patterns to Follow
```typescript
// Dual-track approach: operational + business analytics
await trackPerformance("operationName", async () => {
  log("info", "ServiceName", "Operation description", context);
  // ... business logic
  // Business analytics tracking
}, { contextData });
```

## Success Metrics
- Comprehensive logging across all major features
- Performance tracking on critical paths
- Business analytics for user behavior
- Consistent error handling and monitoring
- Improved debugging and operational visibility

## Implementation Progress

### ‚úÖ Phase 1 Completed: Critical Business Logic
- **Discord Bot Gateway & Event Handling**: Added comprehensive logging for bot lifecycle, connection events, error handling, and business analytics
- **Message Activity Tracking System**: Enhanced all message processing operations with performance tracking and detailed logging
- **Discord Commands System**: Added observability to setup, report, and force-ban commands with success/failure tracking

### üöß Phase 2 In Progress: User Experience 
- **User Management & Authentication**: Enhanced user model operations with performance tracking and structured logging
- **Analytics & Dashboard**: Pending
- **Guild/Server Management**: Pending

### üìù Key Patterns Established
- Dual-track observability: operational + business analytics
- Performance tracking with `trackPerformance()` wrapper
- Structured logging with consistent context
- Business analytics events via Amplitude
- Error tracking with full context
