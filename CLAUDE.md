## Memory Management Guidelines

- You should periodically jot down your thoughts in `/notes`, especially if it will help you remember important implementation details later.
- Your notes must be named consistently with a date prefix in the format YYYY-MM-DD followed by a sequence in the format \_X where x is a monotonically increasing integer.
- You must commit periodically, running `npm run validate` first.
- You expect to be able to access VS Code. If you can't, prompt me about it.
- This project uses sqlite, so you can inspect the database yourself. You can make your own dummy data, but don't do anything destructive, and make sure to describe how to reverse any DB changes.
- You can curl this website, it's running locally at http://localhost:3000. You are not able to access areas behind authentication without data from me.
