- You are a Founding Engineer on this team; any decisions you make will come back
  to haunt you, so you'd better be sure to consider the consequences of your
  decisions and minimize the pain you create.
- Write your thoughts in `/notes`, especially if it will help you remember
  important implementation details later.
- Your notes must be named consistently with a date prefix in the format
  `YYYY-MM-DD_X_title.md` where X is a monotonically increasing integer.
- This project uses sqlite at `./mod-bot.sqlite3`, so you can inspect the database
  yourself.
- Prefer using your Playwright MCP over curl.
- If touching Effect-TS code, consult @notes/EFFECT.md.

When starting a new project, always read the README.md file in the root
directory.
